The goal of this project is to use the seaborn package to perform exploratory data analysis across different charts of a restaurant tips data set.

## About the dataset
The dataset consists of 244 data points stored as rows with 6 columns

* **total_bill**: the amount spent by the customer** 
* **tip**: the amount of the tip received by the establishment** 
* **dessert**: whether or not dessert was ordered** 
* **day**: the day of the week the order was placed** 
* **time**: whether the order took place at lunch or dinner time** 
* **size**: number of people**
