This project aims to build a machine learning model to reduce the number of tests needed to diagnose a specific type of cancer, dealing with high dimensional data.

The knowledge needed to build this project was obtained through the [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) learning platform, in the course [Machine Learning: dealing with data of many dimensions](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/reducao-dimensionalidade).

## About the dataset
The dataset consists of 569 data points stored as rows with 35 columns, where 33 columns are about exams

* **id:** unique pacient identifier
* **diagnostico:** test diagnosis, where 'M' is malignant cancer type and 'B' is benign
* **exames_1 until exames_33:** values of each respective exam

This is a fictitious data set created from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

## Installation
