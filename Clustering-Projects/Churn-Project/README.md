The project aims to use Machine Learning algorithms to create a model capable of predicting the Churn of a telecom company. Three different models were developed to accomplish this task: the KNN, the Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and the Decision Trees.


The knowledge needed to build this project was obtained through the [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) learning platform, in the course [Machine Learning: classification behind the scenes](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/machine-learning-classificacao-tras-panos), with some changes and additions to the course design.

## About the dataset
The dataset consists of 7043 data points stored as rows with 18 columns, with the target column "Churn" and the other columns describe the customer's personal information, such as whether he is over 65 or not, if he has dependents, and if he is married. The remaining columns inform about the services subscribed to in the plan.


The dataset used was based on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets?select=churn-bigml-20.csv).
