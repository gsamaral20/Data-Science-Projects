Beer is one of the most democratic and widely consumed beverages in the world. Not without reason, it is perfect for almost any situation, from happy hour to large wedding parties.

The goal of this project is to create a Machine Learning model using Linear Regression to demonstrate the impacts of the variables provided in this dataset on beer consumption (Y). 

At the end of the project we will have a predictive model for the average beer consumption according to the inputs of a set of variables (X's).

## About the dataset
The dataset consists of 365 data points stored as rows with 7

* **data:** date
* **temp_media:** average temperature (°C)
* **temp_min:** min. temperature (°C)
* **temp_max:** max. temperature (°C)
* **chuva:** precipitation (mm)
* **fds:** weekend (1 = Yes; 0 = No)es.
* **consumo:** beer consumption (liters) 

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and the link can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dongeorge/beer-consumption-sao-paulo
